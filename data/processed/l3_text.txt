of his own youth long ago, when he quit football and started karate practice before hardly
getting his equipment dirty. So when Jacob’s birthday came around, Jacob was both surprised and
pleased to find the magician’s kit that he had desired so badly with a big bright bow on it.
Jacob opened up the box and unwrapped the many parts in the kit. As he did so, he imagined sawing his
pet cat in half and putting it back together to the amazement of his friends and family. He took the many
fake coins, trick cards, and rope pieces of varying length on the kitchen table and imagined pulling
rabbits out of his hat and turning them into pigeons with a mysterious puff of smoke. As Jacob
continued pulling plastic thumbs, foam balls, and giant playing cards out of the magic kit, a commercial
on the TV caught his attention. “Hey kids! Have you ever wanted to go to space? Experience what it’s
like to be an astronaut? Do you want to explore the universe? Well, now you can.” As the commercial
continued playing, Jacob walked away from the magic kit on the kitchen table and stared at the TV
screen longingly. “For only $195 you can go to space camp and live life like an astronaut for a whole
weekend. Enroll now for a once in a life time experience.” Jacob’s cry rang throughout the house as he
yelled, “MOM!” He now knew what his true purpose in life was. arying length on the kitchen table and imagined pulling
